# Welcome to ENS-MOBILE-APP ðŸ‘‹

Before installing dependencies, you must first:
- go to the environments folder
- copy .env.dist
- rename the copied into just .env

1. Install dependencies (make sure node is v22.14.0)

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Login to expo (make sure your expo go app is also logged in to the same account as it is here)

   ```bash
   npx expo login
   ```

3. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```
